# Product Overview

## Running Plan Generator

A Vue 3 web application that generates personalized running training plans based on scientific training principles. The system creates customized training schedules incorporating different workout types (Zone 2, intervals, tempo runs, long runs, hill repeats) while allowing users to specify preferences for program length, race distance, training frequency, and scheduling constraints.

## Key Features

- **Race Distance Support**: 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon training plans
- **Scientific Training Principles**: 80/20 training distribution, progressive overload (max 10% weekly increase), periodization phases, proper recovery periods
- **Customizable Parameters**: Program length (6-24 weeks), training days per week (3-7), rest day preferences, deload frequency
- **Metric System**: All distances in kilometers, paces in minutes per kilometer
- **Training Science Engine**: Implements established running science with deload weeks, phase periodization, and workout distribution

## Target Users

Runners seeking structured, science-based training plans that can be customized to their schedule and experience level, from beginners to advanced athletes preparing for races from 5K to marathon distance.

## Current Status

Core training science algorithms implemented and tested. Focus areas include progressive overload calculations, workout distribution logic, and phase periodization management.
